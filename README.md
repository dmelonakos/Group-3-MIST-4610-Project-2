We created one calculated field for our data analysis. This field finds the number of trips over 100 miles and then divides this by the county population on the average day. We took the 100-250 mile, 250-500 mile, and 500-plus mile trips and then divided them by the total population per county found in this dataset. 

## Question 1 and Why We Asked It

## Question 1 Results and Analysis


## Question 2 and Why We Asked it
### Question 2
How has the average number of trips > 100 miles per capita daily been changing in different states over the past 5 years?
### Reasoning
We wanted to know how the percentage of people taking long distance trips was changing over time in different states and if there was a significant relationship between time and that value. If we knew which states were likely to have an increase in long distance travel, we could advertise fuel efficient vehicles in those areas, invest in real estate for lodging, invest in more efficient public long distance transportation (trains), and make any number of other investment/policy decisions.
